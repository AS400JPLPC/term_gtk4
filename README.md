Terminal window for your console applications
I am pleased to share TermHX, a tool I developed over five years ago to meet a specific need: 
encapsulating terminal applications in a secure graphical window.

Unlike traditional terminals, TermHX does not seek to reinvent the wheel.

It simply provides a controlled window for launching your favorite terminal applications (such as Helix, Vim, or business tools) without the risk of accidental closure or unauthorized access.
I decided to publish it because I have never found a similar tool, and I hope it will be useful to others.

The code is simple, lightweight, and easy to adapt to your needs.
